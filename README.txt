The triOS College organization (triosdevelopers.com) is open to any student currently enrolled at triOS/Eastern.

To join this organization, your instructor will send you an invite. 
Alternatively, you can email jason.eckert@trios.com from your triOS/Eastern email address and I will send you an invite.

Have fun, and enjoy GitHub Enterprise - It's a great place to store your code, and learn new techniques!

Feel free to create as many Projects, Teams and Repositories as you like (there are no limits).

Here is a simple tutorial on how to use Git and GitHub:
