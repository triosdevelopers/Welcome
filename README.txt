The triOS College organization (triosdevelopers.com) is open to any student currently enrolled at triOS/Eastern.

To join this organization, your instructor will send you an invite. 
Alternatively, you can email jason.eckert@trios.com from your triOS/Eastern email address and I will send you an invite.

Have fun, and enjoy GitHub Enterprise - It's a great place to store your code, and learn new techniques!

Feel free to create as many Projects, Teams and Repositories as you like (there are no limits).

If you want to experiment with running your code on a cloud host, I'll be creating a tutorial on how to use GitHub Actions (like GitLab Runners) for executing your code within containers on our Kubernetes cloud host (cloud.triosdevelopers.com) soon! Stay tuned!
Cheers,
Jason.
